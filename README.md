# Cheapolino  
  
The easy-to-build budget version of Nokolino with advanced power saving by using MOSFET switch. Cheapolino aims to cost less then **10€** per kit.  

* **07.01.2026** Stalled work on Cheapolino for Schimpfolino und Arduino extensions work. Hopefully, Cheapolino will be ready in March.  
* **09.08.2024** New boards with a RX - TX resistor for noise reduction.
* **09.07.2024** Firmware **1.0-09072024** with better random seed.  
* **25.06.2024** Gerber files added.  
* **25.06.2024** The PCBs arrived, a testing Cheapolino was build and runs perfectly!  
* **08.06.2024** Since one week, Cheapolino ist running without any issues! As soon as the new PCBs will arrive, he will be build with a PCB and tested for another week before publishing.

## Todo
  
* Rewrite Code with better interrupt
* Build third prototype with resistors
* Find better speaker
